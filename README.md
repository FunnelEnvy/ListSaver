# List Saver

Using Mailchimp to manage your subscriber list and campaigns? You could be
losing a lot of potential subscribers because they forget to complete the
double-opt in. List Saver helps you recover those 'lost' subscribers and
improves the conversion rates to your email list.

List Saver is a WordPress plugin that automatically captures email addresses
from a Mailchimp form, and sends the subscriber a follow up "reminder" email after a
certain (configurable) number of days if they haven't signed up. It uses the
Mailchimp API to check if they've signed up and only sends them an email if they
haven't.

## Features

* Works with any Mailchimp custom form
* Configurable interval (days) to check
* Will only send the reminder if the email is not already on the list (no
  duplicate messages).
* Completely editable reminder email text
* Automatically adds the user to the list if they click on the link in the
  reminder email
* View Pending and Actvated (saved) subsribers
* Reminders run as a WordPress background process to minimize any performance
  impact

## Installation

1. Upload the `list-saver` directory into your `wp-content/plugins` directory
2. Navigate to the *Plugins* dashboard page
3. Locate the menu item that reads *List Saver*
4. Click on *Activate*

This will activate the WordPress Plugin Boilerplate. Because the Boilerplate has no real functionality, nothing will be added to WordPress; however, this demonstrates exactly how your plugin should behave while you're working with the Boilerplate.
